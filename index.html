        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Seeking a position in a company where I can launch my career and build a valuable skill set. </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Master's in computer science - Northern Arizona University (2022-2024)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Academic Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Fuel Theft Indicator:</h3></li>
            <p>Arduino-based vehicle fuel theft detector system is a prototype that uses Arduino UNO as a microcontroller, IComSat v1.1 SIM900 GSM/GPRS Shield to communicate with mobile phone, fuel level sensor as a volume detector, and push button as a detector to check whether the fuel tankâ€™s lid is open or closed. The working principle of this system is to detect the state of the fuel tank lid. When the lid is open, the system will make a phone call. Then, the system will keep track of fuel volume.</p>
            <li><h3>Voting machine:</h3></li> 
            <p>Electronic voting machine has already been developed and widely used in many developed countries. But most of them use Radio Frequency ID. In developing countries RFID for each person does not exist. And using RFID is still a costly solution. Some of the developing countries use image processing technique to detect citizens. But only image processing is not enough. Keeping these problems in mind we have developed this project where raspberry pi will be used as host.</p>
            <li><h3>Variable Speed Transmission System:</h3></li> 
            <p>Gearboxes are frequently used in an automobile for power transmission as torque requirement of a vehicle vary with speed. I designed a novel variable-speed transmission model wherein hydraulics levers mechanism gear ratio will automatically vary by using the weight ball which gets the information from output flywheel. This whole process is completed without any human input. It also transfers power and speed efficiently than any other present transmissions and is also cheap.</p>
